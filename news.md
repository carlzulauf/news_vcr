### Common problems (and solutions) when starting Docker with Rails

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/2s38qm-common-problems-and-solutions-when-starting-docker-with-rails

There are a lot of blog posts out there explaining how to get started with Docker. But in our recent experiments we’ve run into a couple of issues, so we’ve compiled a list of our encountered problems and their solutions on [our latest post](http://cookieshq.co.uk/posts/common-problems-when-starting-with-docker-and-rails/).

### Slides: Recurring events with Montrose

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/ze6zg1-slides-recurring-events-with-montrose

I gave a talk at the NYC.rb meetup on modeling recurring events in Ruby with the [Montrose](https://github.com/rossta/montrose) gem. Montrose bills itself as an easy-to-use library for defining recurring events in Ruby. It uses a simple chaining system for building recurrences, inspired heavily by the design principles of [HTTP.rb](https://github.com/httprb/http). Slides are posted here: [https://rossta.net/talks/recurring-events-with-montrose.html](https://rossta.net/talks/recurring-events-with-montrose.html)

### Where and why I'm still using Rails

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/cbkxkm-where-and-why-im-still-using-rails

I’ve had many interesting conversations with experienced Ruby/Rails programmers recently. One of the topics that often pops up is when it makes sense (for us) to still use Rails, given the variety of other choices. [This blogpost](http://blog.arkency.com/2016/02/where-and-why-im-still-using-rails/) aims to summarize some of views here.

### How to Remove a Column with Zero Downtime in Ruby on Rails

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/n4ib7b-how-to-remove-a-column-with-zero-downtime-in-ruby-on-rails

For a production Ruby on Rails application, uptime is paramount. Altering the structure of an application’s persistence layer is an operation that competes directly with uptime. Specifically, removing a table column within a relational database causes issues with the ActiveRecord ORM. [This particular pain point has been removed as of Ruby on Rails 4.0.0, saving developers a lot of headache and greatly reducing the need for structural change coordination](http://jakeyesbeck.com/2016/02/07/how-to-remove-a-column-with-zero-downtime-in-ruby-on-rails/).

### Octopress 3 (Jekyll’s Ferrari) Docu Reformatted as a Single-Page B-n-W Book

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/s3j4r6-octopress-3-jekylls-ferrari-docu-reformatted-as-a-single-page-b-n-w-book

Hello, As a follow-up idea to the Jekyll Docu (Book Edition). Another idea / experiment: Let’s use the READMEs of all the great plugins and tools for Jekyll in the Octopress 3.0 toolkit and reformat it into a single-page black ‘n’ white book. Still early and a work-in-progess. See the [source repo](https://github.com/planetjekyll/octopress) and the auto-generated [book page](http://planetjekyll.github.io/octopress) using - of course - “plain” Jekyll w/ GitHub Pages. Let us know what you think. Has anyone migrated to Octopress 3.0 (from 2.0)? Cheers.

### New Rails apps monitoring tool

http://www.rubyflow.com/p/9uqfz2-new-rails-apps-monitoring-tool

Hi, I started building a Rails apps monitoring tool a year ago. It started as a side project for my own needs. I wanted to track performances and errors for both requests and background jobs. Later with the help of a designer friend it gets a pretty nice UI. Then I decided to launch it to see how it goes. So I take this opportunity to share it and I am still looking for feedbacks. Here is the link [https://www.rorvswild.com](https://www.rorvswild.com)
